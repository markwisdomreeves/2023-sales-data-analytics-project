Supermarket Sales - Data Analytics Project

Objective: In this project, I performed data analysis on an open dataset that provides an in-depth look at the ordering, billing, and sales processes in a supermarket. 
Some of the tasks include:
Data cleansing, 
Data transformation, 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data virtualization.

With information ranging from customers' meal choices to the value of their orders and whether they were converted into sales, this dataset opens up endless possibilities to uncover consumer behavior trends and engagement within the business.

From understanding who is exchanging with the company and when to see what types of meals are most popular with consumers, this rich collection of data will allow us to gain priceless insights into consumer actions and habits that can inform strategic decisions.
